## Hello there

graph_project - It's my C++, you guessed it, graph project, aiming at answering which type of political system is the most stable (more about it in project README.md).
graph_data_reading - VERY basic graph ploting in python for graph_project data.
slotMachineSim - Simulator of slot machine written using Qt.
slotDB - Database written in C++ (based on json files, whatever) for slotMachineSim.

And btw, Arcane is great, you should probably watch it if you haven't.
